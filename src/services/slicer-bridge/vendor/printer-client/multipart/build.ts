// The body of a G-code upload (POST /server/files/upload), built once. Every route sends these bytes: the printer's
// own origin, the relay (the gateway checks them strictly and rebuilds them, checkUpload), and a host that uploads
// for a framed client. Building the body by hand rather than from a FormData keeps the boundary the header names and
// the boundary the body uses the same: each serialisation of a FormData picks a new one, so taking the bytes from one
// and the Content-Type from another sends a body the gateway refuses.
//
// The body has exactly three parts, in this order: root = gcodes, checksum = the file's SHA-256 (Moonraker answers
// 422 when the file it wrote differs), and the file. Never `path` (the file goes in the root) and never `print`: a
// print is started by its own request, after the person confirmed it and the printer's checks passed.
