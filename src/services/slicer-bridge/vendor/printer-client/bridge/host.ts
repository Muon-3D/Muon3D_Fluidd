// Technologies Limited, under the Apache License 2.0 (vendor/printer-client/LICENSE and NOTICE). Changed for
// Fluidd by tools/vendor-printer-client.cjs: relative imports without ".ts"; Object.hasOwn as hasOwnProperty.call.
// The host's side of printer-bridge/1 (protocol.ts), without a framework: the page that frames a printer client (Fluidd's
// /slice, the reference host in the tests) creates one BridgeHost for its frame and gives it an adapter, its own
// connection to the printer it has selected. The helper is the boundary: the frame may be hostile (a compromised client
// origin framed in every console user's Fluidd), so everything a request may do is decided here, never by the frame.
//
// - The handshake. createBridgeHost() listens before the host sets the frame's src. It answers a hello only from the
//   frame's own window and from the origin of the src it set, with one welcome per hello (a new nonce, as a reload
//   sends, starts a new session and ends the old one: its port, its running requests, its uploads and approvals). It
//   never reads document.referrer.
// - The selected printer. Every request names a printer key; one that is not the host's selection now is refused with
//   `printer-changed`, and when the selection changes (printerChanged()) the frame is told first (printer.changed),
//   then every request still running for the old printer ends with `printer-changed` and its status watch stops. A
//   write (an upload, a print, a queue entry, a cancel) also ends when its printer becomes watch-only or offline, unless
//   the printer already has it; each step of a write checks the selection again.
// - Reads: Moonraker's read allowlist only (READ_METHODS), each parameter checked before the adapter puts it in a URL.
//   Status comes from the host's own subscription (the adapter's status feed), at most 4 events a second.
// - Uploads: the helper builds the multipart body itself (multipart/build.ts: root, checksum, file; never print, never
//   a path) from the name, checksum and bytes the frame sent. It never replaces a file in the printer's queue, the file
//   it is printing, or a file this session did not write: the upload is stored under the next free name instead
//   (a_2.gcode, a_3.gcode, …), and the answer names it. Each stored path is recorded, per printer, in this session's
//   upload set.
// - The start is the host's. print.request is refused unless every path is in the upload set for that printer and was
//   uploaded within 30 minutes. The host then shows its own dialog (the adapter's confirm: "Print ‹file› on
//   ‹printer›?", "Plate is clear", Upload only, Print). For a start, the host reads the printer's last job itself and
//   asks "Plate is clear" whenever that job deposited material or the history cannot be read, whatever the frame said
//   (the frame's `ask` only asks more often); a queue entry never asks. On Print, with the printer still selected and
//   the tick given where it was asked, it reads print_stats again: a start needs standby, complete, cancelled or error
//   and starts the first path; a queue needs printing or paused and queues them all. Upload only (and the dialog's ✕
//   or Esc) answers uploaded-only in either mode, and approves nothing. The other paths of a start are approved for
//   queue.add, once each, for 30 minutes, and only while the printer prints or is paused; queue.add shows no dialog
//   (the start's was the one for every path of the send). The frame's `cancel` closes a dialog still open, and nothing
//   starts. print.cancel cancels only the job this frame started: that file printing or paused, and (where the printer
//   keeps a history) the first job after the one before the start, so a later print of the same name from the host's
//   own file list is not the frame's to cancel.
// - Viewers never upload or print; a printer the host lists offline answers `offline`.
//
// An adapter's error reaches the frame as it is only when it is a PrinterError (errors/kinds.ts), so a host that maps
// its printer's answers with errors/parse.ts passes the printer's own words through. Any other error (a fetch's, a
// socket's: they may name URLs and tokens) reaches the frame as "The host could not do it"; its words go to the log.
//
// The adapter's reads answer as Moonraker does, and a read of something that is not there (a missing file's
// metadata, a printer without [history] or [job_queue]) rejects with a PrinterError whose status is 404.
