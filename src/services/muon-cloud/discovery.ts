/**
 * Finds Muon3D printers on the network this browser is on.
 *
 * A browser cannot browse mDNS, so this asks addresses directly. Every M1
 * answers `GET /server/muon/identity` on port 80. The search goes in order:
 * the printers Fluidd already knows, then the /24 networks those printers sit
 * on, then the common home networks whose gateway (.1 or .254) answers
 * quickly, then the Windows hotspot network.
 *
 * An address nobody holds and an address on a network the browser has no route
 * to both just time out, so only a gateway that answers says that a network is
 * there. On a Windows hotspot the gateway is this machine, and its firewall
 * drops the probe, so that network is swept without the check.
 *
 * The sweep is paced. Chromium slows down when it cancels many pending
 * connections at once. Above about 25 a second, later probes wait in its queue
 * past their own timeout, and a printer that answers in 60 ms is missed.
 * Measured on 2026-09-23: 64 probes at a time with a 3 s timeout found the
 * printer every time. At 0.8 s or 1.5 s it was missed.
 *
 * A page served over HTTPS may use plain HTTP and WebSockets on the LAN only
 * in Chromium, and only after the person allows "look for devices on your
 * local network". Chrome asks once, at the first local request. Measured on
 * 2026-09-24 in Chrome 153 from app.muon3d.com: fetch and ws:// to a private
 * address both worked, with or without `targetAddressSpace: 'local'`, so
 * Fluidd connects to a printer on the LAN from the HTTPS site as it does
 * from the printer's own page. The sweep still declares it. Other browsers
 * block those requests as mixed content, and the sweep finds nothing there.
 *
 * The Muon3D service fills that gap in any browser: it lists the printers
 * that connect to it from this browser's public address
 * (`refreshCloudNearby`), linked or not.
